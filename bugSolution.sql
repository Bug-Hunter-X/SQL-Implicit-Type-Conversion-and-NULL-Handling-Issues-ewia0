The provided example in `bug.sql` demonstrates scenarios involving implicit type conversions and NULL comparisons. To resolve these, follow best practices for explicit type casting and proper NULL handling. Here's a corrected version in `bugSolution.sql`:

```sql
-- Correct way to compare employee_id (assuming it's an integer)
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE CAST(employee_id AS VARCHAR(255)) = '123';

--Handling NULLS
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id IS NULL OR employee_id = 123;

-- Or using COALESCE to provide a default value for NULLs
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE COALESCE(employee_id, 0) = 123; 
```

Ensure the explicit cast matches the data type of the column and that date comparisons use the same format. Always use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` when directly comparing to `NULL`, or handle nulls using `COALESCE` for conditional logic. This guarantees the query produces the correct and expected result, reducing errors and improving the reliability of your database operations.
