In SQL, a common yet often overlooked error stems from implicit type conversions within queries.  For example, comparing a numeric column to a string literal without explicit casting can lead to unexpected results or errors. The database might attempt to implicitly convert the values, potentially causing unexpected data type mismatches.  Consider this scenario:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id = '123';
```

If `employee_id` is an integer column, the database will attempt to convert the string '123' to an integer. While this often works, it can fail if the string cannot be parsed as an integer (e.g., '123a').  This can cause the query to return an incorrect or empty result set, and error messages might not be very descriptive.

Another issue is related to date and time comparisons.  Using incorrect formatting or data types when comparing dates can produce illogical results. If the database server interprets dates in a different format than what your query expects, it can lead to comparisons not matching your intentions.  For instance, a query comparing a `DATE` column to a string representation of a date might fail due to conflicting formats.

Finally, neglecting to handle `NULL` values appropriately during comparisons can introduce bugs. Comparing a column that might contain `NULL` values using `=` will always yield `false`, even if the intended comparison is for equality.  To address null values, utilize the `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` operators, or the `COALESCE` function to substitute a default value for `NULL`.
